## MIDI Soundboard

This is a simple example of an Objective-C iOS app that uses MIKMIDI to create an onscreen piano keyboard. It can also connect to and receive MIDI from a connected MIDI keyboard.

It demonstrates the use of MIKMIDICommand, MIKMIDISynthesizer, MIKMIDIDevice, MIKMIDIResponder, and other MIKMIDI APIs.

**Note**: This example was originally written when MIKMIDI was first being developed. Some aspects of it could be done better with newer MIKMIDI API. The roadmap for MIKMIDI 1.7 includes updating or replacing this example with better iOS example code.
